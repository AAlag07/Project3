	<h1> Internet Humor and its effects</h1>

			<h2> A Preface </h2>
			<p> Ever since it's conception, the internet has been a hyperlane for information to be quickly exchanged through 
			numerous users and over various regions. Comedy is not without inclusion in that information. 
			The most common in this internet comedy is in the forms of internet memes. 
			Memes are easily spread through the medium of the internet and can be anything from an image to an idea. 
			Internet sensations can be considered as memes, as well as their following renditions to further 
			images and comedic parodies. </p>

			<p class="solid"> This particular video encapsulates the idea of being internet comedy in the modern age. A short video with a comedic premise like this cat suddenly going into a sick breakdance spin sets it up to be easily replicated to a reposter's comedic effect.</p>

			<h2> The need for shorter videos, does that mean our attention spans are getting worse? </h2>
			<p> Not just for funny internet videos, but a topic that is thrown around often is the idea that as a society, our human attention spans have gotten shorter. Most likely attributed to the shorter forms of content we see on TikTok and Instagram. A good idea to take in
			is that in the modern age of ideas and topics being thrown around in a digital space at hyperfast speeds, we like to multitask viewing these videos as we do other things. </p>
			<p> Imagine, you are waiting in line or when waiting for your food, you have the time to pull up your phone but no time to commit to something like watching a full length video or comedy act. So instead to view forms of media that a quick, no more than 30 seconds, you would get your fill of wanting different topics to see but also condense material so that you may pay attention to whatever matter you were waiting for. </p>
			<h2> Evolution of Internet Humor </h2>
			<p> As the years pass, I've seen internet humor change. Especially in the forms of comedic memes that are passed from community to community. From the early youtube-era of clear-cut comedy with punchlines or actors doing bits. Modern memes can be esoteric in the way that they present the content. The particular 
			category of "dank memes" and "s**tposts" surface. They can be created to make light of any situation, in a negative or positive light. From turning the most mundane into comical situations. I personally think these types of humor have become common in digital culture as they are ways to make any situation into content for others to enjoy. Or, you can be overwhelmed with so much confusion from what you just saw, that your only reaction can be laughter. </p>

			<p class="solid"> The youtube video above has 812k views, this isn't because of some wholly dedicated comedic exercise or well-thought out plan. It is a 10 minute video of a banana falling over, the anticipation and ironic end is what garners the video so much ironic praise and ultimately makes it "funny". </p>

			<div class="tooltip"> This gif
					<span class="tooltiptext">(pronounced as gif or jif? the fictional war over its pronounciation can be considered a long standing internet meme itself.) </span> shows a person reacting wackily to the idea of going back to school. The reaction is unwarranted and intending for something else entirely, but it plays on the earlier serious reaction images to returning to school and plays it off as a overly dramatic scenario. This meme is also reposted, as seen with the two overlaying captions, owing to its popularity and ironic nature more.
